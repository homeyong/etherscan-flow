# Etherscan Flow — Entry flows: Steps 0A, 0B, 0C

> Part of the `etherscan-flow` skill. Read this when the entry point is an address (victim / scammer / unknown role), a free-form narrative, or a pasted document / user-typed link. After these steps, continue with Steps 1–4 in `references/trace-steps.md`. Every Hard rule, the 100-call budget, and the validation rules in `SKILL.md` apply here unchanged.

## Step 0A — Address-first flow (victim address)

Use when the user provides a victim wallet and no tx hash.

### 0A-1. Normal transactions

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=txlist&address={VICTIM_ADDRESS}&startblock=0&endblock=99999999&page=1&offset=50&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0A-2. ERC-20 token transfers

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=tokentx&address={VICTIM_ADDRESS}&page=1&offset=50&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0A-3. ERC-721 / NFT transfers

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=tokennfttx&address={VICTIM_ADDRESS}&page=1&offset=20&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0A-4. Score and identify the suspicious event(s)

| Signal | Score | What it looks like |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| Token `transferFrom` where victim is `from` but did not initiate the tx (tx `from` ≠ victim address) | +5 | Approval drain |
| `approve()` to an unverified contract followed within 5 blocks by a large token outflow | +4 | Phishing approval |
| ETH or tokens sent to a known mixer | +4 | Laundering |
| Multiple tokens drained in the same block | +4 | Sweeper bot |
| `setApprovalForAll` on an NFT contract | +3 | NFT drainer setup |
| NFT batch transfer out in a single tx | +3 | NFT drainer |
| Contract call to an address created in the same block or within last 100 blocks | +3 | Fresh scam contract |
| Large outgoing ETH transfer (>0.1 ETH) to an address with <10 lifetime txs | +3 | Suspicious ETH send |
| Large outflow to an address victim never interacted with before | +2 | Suspicious destination |
| tx failed (status=0) but internal txs still moved funds | +2 | Reentrancy or unusual drain |

If the user gave an approximate time, filter to a ±12 hour window first.

Record the top 3 candidates (one line each) in `_meta.candidates`. **Do not ask the user to pick** — proceed automatically with the highest-scoring candidate. If the top two are close (within 2 points), note the ambiguity in `_meta.gaps` and continue anyway. Asking to choose a candidate is never a reason to pause (Execution mode).

### 0A-5. Continue

Set identified tx(es) as seed and proceed to **Step 1**. Add the subject address to the entity set as `victim_wallet` only if a drain candidate scored ≥ 5; otherwise use `unknown_eoa?` and add an `unverified_claim` entry to `_meta.gaps` (Hard rule 3).

## Step 0B — Scammer-first flow (known attacker/scammer address)

Use when the user provides a known scammer/attacker address. The goal is to find their victims and trace where funds went.

### 0B-1. Normal transactions (most recent 50)

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=txlist&address={SCAMMER_ADDRESS}&startblock=0&endblock=99999999&page=1&offset=50&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0B-2. Token transfers (most recent 50)

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=tokentx&address={SCAMMER_ADDRESS}&page=1&offset=50&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0B-3. NFT transfers

```
GET https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid={CHAINID}&module=account&action=tokennfttx&address={SCAMMER_ADDRESS}&page=1&offset=20&sort=desc&apikey={APIKEY}
```

### 0B-4. Identify victims and key events

Scan the results looking for:

| Signal | Role assignment |
|--------|----------------|
| Addresses that appear as `from` in token `transferFrom` calls the scammer initiated | `victim_wallet` candidate |
| Addresses that sent large ETH to the scammer | `victim_wallet` candidate |
| Addresses the scammer immediately forwarded funds to | `intermediate_wallet` candidate |
| Known mixer/CEX addresses receiving funds | Stop tracing that branch |
| Multiple different addresses losing funds to the scammer | Repeat scammer / drainer bot |

The user's "scammer" claim is unverified until proven (Hard rule 3). Assign `attacker_eoa` (or `scam_contract` if it's a contract — check in Step 2) **only if the scan finds supporting evidence**: `transferFrom` drains it initiated, multiple victim-pattern inflows, rapid forwarding of received funds, or a negative nametag reputation. If no evidence is found, assign `unknown_eoa?` and add an `unverified_claim` entry to `_meta.gaps` — never label an address a scammer on the user's word alone.

Identify the **earliest suspicious tx** (the first victim event or the first drain) as the seed tx. Record the findings — first drain, victim count, forwarding addresses — in `_meta`, not as chat text.

### 0B-5. Continue

Set the earliest drain tx as seed and proceed to **Step 1**. Entity set already has the subject address.

## Step 0C — Hypothesis-first flow (user narrative)

Use when the user describes what they think happened in free-form text — with or without specific addresses. The goal is to extract every testable claim, validate each one against the Etherscan API, and build the graph only from what is confirmed.

**Core rule: a hypothesis is a queue of API calls to make, not a source of truth. Nothing from the user's narrative enters the graph unvalidated.**

### 0C-0. Document and link import (gists, tweets, articles, pasted drafts)

Use this when the entry point is a document rather than a sentence — pasted text, a draft case JSON, or any URL the user typed: a GitHub gist, a tweet/X post, a news article, a blog post, a forum thread. Convert it into a narrative for 0C-1:

1. **Pasted content** — use the text as-is.
2. **User-typed URL(s)** — fetch each one once under the input-fetch exception in Hard rule 2: read-only GET, no API key or credential attached, exactly the URLs the user typed and nothing linked from inside them. If a fetch fails or returns no useful text (login-walled or JS-only pages — common for X/Twitter), do not stop the run: ask the user to paste the content if it is the only entry point, otherwise note `input_url_unreadable` in `_meta.gaps` and continue with the remaining input. Never reconstruct an unreadable page from memory.
3. **Draft flow JSON** — never import its nodes/edges into the output. Decompose it into claims: each node address becomes a seed address, each edge becomes a flow claim (from, to, amount, token, txhash if present), each role becomes a role claim. A txhash found in the draft is a *claim* to verify via `eth_getTransactionByHash`, not a verified hash.
4. Feed the resulting claims into 0C-1. Everything from the document is unverified until 0C-2 confirms it against the API; whatever fails validation lands in `_meta.gaps` as `unverified_claim`, exactly as for a spoken hypothesis.

The document is input, never output: the case JSON is still built exclusively from API responses fetched in this run.

### 0C-1. Parse the narrative

Extract every structured claim from the user's text:

| Claim type | Example text | What to extract |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Address with role hint | "this attacker 0xABC…" | address + claimed role |
| Flow claim | "0xABC… sent 5000 USDT to 0xDEF…" | from, to, amount, token — all unverified |
| Approval claim | "0xABC… approved 0xDEF… to spend USDT" | from, spender, token — unverified |
| Mixer/CEX claim | "funds went to Tornado Cash" | destination role assertion — check landmark list |
| Token name without address | "drained in PEPE" | token symbol hint — resolve contract via `tokentx` results |
| Tx hash | "the drain tx is 0xHASH…" | direct seed — go to Step 1 |
| Block / date hint | "happened around March 15" | narrow block range for API calls |
| Chain hint | "on Base" | set chainid accordingly |

Build two lists from the parse:
- **Seed addresses** — every 0x address mentioned
- **Claim queue** — every flow/approval/role assertion to verify

### 0C-2. Validate each claim via API

For every address in seed addresses, run Steps 2 classification calls (nametag, eth_getCode, balance, txlist).

For every claim in the claim queue, run the minimum API calls needed to confirm or deny it:

| Claim type | Validation API call | Confirmed if… |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| "A sent X TOKEN to B" | `tokentx` for address A, filter by token symbol and recipient B | A matching transfer event exists with txhash |
| "A approved B" | `txlist` for address A — find a tx to the token contract whose `input` starts with the `approve` selector (`0x095ea7b3`) and encodes B as spender | Matching approval tx exists |
| "funds went to mixer" | Check if destination is in known landmark list | Address matches a known mixer address |
| "A is the attacker" | `txlist` for A — check account age, tx count, first tx timing vs claimed event | Consistent with attacker profile |
| "drained TOKEN" | `tokentx` for claimed victim/attacker addresses around claimed date | Outflow of that token confirmed |
| Flow amount claim | Compare claimed amount against actual `value` or token `value` in API result | Within 1% tolerance (rounding) |

### 0C-3. Triage results

After validation, sort every claim into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Confirmed** | API returned a matching tx with real txhash | Create node(s) and edge in the graph |
| **Partially confirmed** | Address exists and is active, but the specific flow couldn't be matched | Create node(s), note gap, no edge |
| **Unverified** | No API evidence found for the claim | Do not create node or edge; add to `_meta.gaps` as `unverified_claim` |

Format unverified claims in gaps as:
```json
{
  "type": "unverified_claim",
  "claim": "user said '0xABC… sent 5000 USDT to 0xDEF…'",
  "checked_via": "tokentx for 0xABC…, blocks 0–99999999",
  "result": "no matching USDT transfer to 0xDEF… found"
}
```

### 0C-4. Continue

Add all confirmed addresses to the entity set with their validated roles. Add confirmed tx hashes to the seed list. Proceed to **Step 1** for any seed tx hashes. If no tx hash was confirmed, choose the earliest validated flow row selected for this investigation as the anchor and store its timestamp as `{ANCHOR_TIMESTAMP}` before proceeding to **Step 3**. If the confirmed addresses have no real transaction or transfer rows, no edge can survive Step 4B: stop without writing a case.
